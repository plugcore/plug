## @plugcore/web

In this package we can find everything that is related to web connectivity

- __Web framework__: For web servers management

- __OAS 3__: We believe that a good documentation is needed for a good API, event if it's just for internal usage. This adds support for an easy creation of [OAS 3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) description files, being able to add little chunks of documentation for each operation created, so it's easily updated at the same time that the code changes, and being able to version it. We take care of the full document creation taking into account all the current configuration.

- __Login__: Easy integration of basic login mechanisms like `basic auth` or `JWT`, but also easy to extend for custom login strategies, and new support will be added in the future.
